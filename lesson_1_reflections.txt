Q)How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

A)The diff command made it very easy to find the bug, as it showed only the lines that were modified.

Q)How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

A)We can roll back to a previous version or compare with a prev version.

Q)What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

A)Pros: u decide when to commit, less history to look at.
Cons: u may not decide to commit regularly and it becomes one big mess.

Q)Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

A) because google docs do not have files which have interdependency.

Q)How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

A)git log to find the specific commit and git diff to compare it to its previous version. One can also use git log --stat to see the insertions and deletions for that specific commit.

Q)How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

A)Since we can always checkout a previos version and find the bug.

Q)Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

A)For everything.
